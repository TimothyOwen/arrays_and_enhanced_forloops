<h2>Arrays</h2>
1. Create an array that will hold 10 integer values, populate the array with values, then call and output each element.
<br> 
<br>
2. Create a for loop that populates an integer array with values, outputting them at each iteration.
   Then create another loop that iterates through the array, changing the values at each point to equal itself times 10, outputting them at each iteration.
<br>
<h2>ArrayList</h2>
Try out using ArrayList yourself:

* Create a new ArrayList
* Add() several elements
* Print out the entire ArrayList
* Iterate through the ArrayList and print out each element (with both normal and enhanced for-loops)
* Get() specific elements
* Set() different elements
* Remove() elements
* Sort() the ArrayList (try this with several object types)
* Try using the reverse(), swap() and clone() methods from the Collections class
